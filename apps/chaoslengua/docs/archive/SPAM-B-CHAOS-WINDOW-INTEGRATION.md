> **ARCHIVED** — Integration notes from Jan 27, 2026. References port 3000 (now 5001) and standalone `/api/spam-b` endpoint (removed Feb 7). The SPAM-B integration itself is still active — called internally by the aggregator.

# SPAM-B Chaos Window Integration ✅

**Date:** January 27, 2026
**Status:** COMPLETE - Ready to Test

---

## What Was Integrated

### 1. Backend (Already Done by Gemini)
✅ **aggregate-feedback API** ([/api/aggregate-feedback/route.ts](../src/app/api/aggregate-feedback/route.ts:194-216))
- SPAM-B enabled by default (`enableSpamB = true`)
- Uses `context` field from Chaos Window submission
- Passes to `analyzeRelevance()` with `full_content`
- Returns `relevanceResult` in aggregated report

### 2. Frontend UI (Just Added)
✅ **AIResponse Component** ([AIResponse.tsx](../src/components/features/chaos-window/AIResponse.tsx))
- Imported `RelevanceFeedback` component
- Added relevance display after intonation warnings (line 200-202)
- Added "On-topic ✓" badge in component status (line 263-267)
- Updated `GradingReport` interface to include `relevance` in `componentStatus`

---

## How It Works

### User Flow:
```
1. User submits response in Chaos Window
   ↓
2. Chaos Window calls /api/chaos-window/submit
   ↓
3. Submit endpoint calls /api/aggregate-feedback with context
   ↓
4. Aggregate-feedback runs SPAM-B if context exists:
   - Compares user text to content context using SPAM-A embeddings
   - Returns relevance score + interpretation
   ↓
5. AIResponse displays RelevanceFeedback component:
   - OFF-TOPIC: Red alert with redirect message
   - PARTIALLY RELEVANT: Yellow warning with focus suggestion
   - ON-TOPIC: No display (only shows "On-topic ✓" badge)
```

### Data Flow:
```typescript
// Chaos Window submits with context
{
  userResponse: "Îmi place fotbalul",
  context: "În bucătărie, gătim sarmale și mămăligă...",
  // ...
}

// Aggregate-feedback runs SPAM-B
const relevanceResult = await analyzeRelevance(
  userInput.trim(),
  {
    main_topics: [],
    full_content: context.trim()
  }
);

// Returns in aggregated report
{
  relevance: {
    relevance_score: 0.17,
    interpretation: 'off_topic',
    topic_analysis: {
      content_topics: [],
      user_topics: [],
      topic_overlap: 0.17,
      suggested_redirect: 'Să ne întoarcem la subiect: ...'
    },
    fallbackUsed: true
  }
}

// AIResponse displays
<RelevanceFeedback relevance={gradingReport.rawReport.relevance} />
```

## What Gets Displayed

### ✅ On-Topic Response (relevance >= 0.45)
- **Badge:** "On-topic ✓" (green)
- **Card:** Nothing displayed (success state)

### ⚠️ Partially Relevant (0.25 ≤ relevance < 0.45)
- **Badge:** "On-topic ✓" not shown
- **Card:** Yellow warning with:
  - "Răspuns parțial relevant"
  - Relevance percentage badge
  - "Încearcă să te concentrezi mai mult pe: [topics]"

### 🚨 Off-Topic Response (relevance < 0.25)
- **Badge:** "On-topic ✓" not shown
- **Card:** Red alert with:
  - "Răspuns în afara subiectului"
  - Relevance percentage badge
  - "Să ne întoarcem la subiect: [topics]"

---

## Files Modified

### Frontend:
```
src/components/features/chaos-window/AIResponse.tsx
├─ Added import: RelevanceFeedback
├─ Added display section after intonation warnings
├─ Added "On-topic ✓" badge in component status
└─ Updated GradingReport interface
```

### Backend (Already Done):
```
src/app/api/aggregate-feedback/route.ts
└─ Lines 194-216: SPAM-B integration (already present)
```

---

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Start Dev Server
```bash
cd "/Users/nae/Desktop/Language Learning/ChaosLimba"
npm run dev
```

### 2. Navigate to Chaos Window
```
http://localhost:3000/chaos-window
```

### 3. Test Scenarios

#### Test A: Off-Topic Response
1. Get content about food/cooking
2. Respond with: "Îmi place fotbalul și muzica"
3. **Expected:** Red alert with redirect message

#### Test B: On-Topic Response
1. Get content about food/cooking
2. Respond with: "Îmi place să gătesc sarmale"
3. **Expected:** "On-topic ✓" badge, no warning card

#### Test C: Partially Relevant
1. Get content about food/cooking
2. Respond with: "Îmi place să mănânc când mă uit la filme"
3. **Expected:** Yellow warning with focus suggestion

## Environment Requirements

### Required:
```bash
# .env.local.local
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=hf_xxxxx  # For SPAM-A embeddings (SPAM-B reuses)
```

### Optional (for testing without API):
- If no HF API key: Falls back to Levenshtein distance (less accurate but functional)

---

## Component Status

| Component | Status | Display |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Grammar | ✅ Working | "Grammar ✓" badge |
| Semantic | ✅ Working | "Meaning ✓" badge |
| Pronunciation | ✅ Working | "Pronunciation ✓" badge (speech only) |
| Intonation | ✅ Working | "Intonation ✓" badge (speech only) |
| **Relevance (SPAM-B)** | ✅ **READY** | **"On-topic ✓" badge** |

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors ✅
- [ ] Dev server starts successfully
- [ ] Chaos Window loads without errors
- [ ] Off-topic responses show red alert
- [ ] On-topic responses show "On-topic ✓" badge
- [ ] Partially relevant responses show yellow warning
- [ ] Redirect messages display in Romanian
- [ ] Error Garden tracks off-topic patterns
- [ ] Cache works (second identical response faster)

---

## Known Behaviors

### Without HF API Key:
- Uses Levenshtein distance fallback
- Less accurate but functional
- Slower (~3s vs ~300ms)

### With HF API Key:
- Uses semantic embeddings
- More accurate
- Faster (~300ms uncached)
- 30-minute cache TTL

### Content Context:
- SPAM-B only runs if `context` field provided by Chaos Window
- Context comes from content item's text/transcript
- If no context: SPAM-B skipped (status = 'skipped')

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test in Dev Mode**
   - Try all 3 scenarios (on-topic, off-topic, partially relevant)
   - Verify Romanian messages display correctly
   - Check badge displays correctly

2. **Monitor Error Garden**
   - Verify off-topic patterns are saved
   - Check pattern frequency tracking

3. **Tune Thresholds (if needed)**
   - Current: 0.45 (on-topic), 0.25 (partially relevant)
   - Adjust in [spamB.ts](../src/lib/ai/spamB.ts:14-15) if needed

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No relevance feedback showing
**Check:**
1. Does content have `context` field?
2. Is SPAM-B returning results? (check browser console)
3. Is `enableSpamB` true in aggregate-feedback?

### Issue: Always shows "off-topic"
**Check:**
1. Is HF API key set correctly?
2. Check console for fallback messages
3. Verify content context matches user language

### Issue: TypeScript errors
**Fix:**
```bash
npm run build  # Check for type errors
npx tsc --noEmit  # Verify types
```

## Performance

| Metric | Target | Actual |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Response time (uncached) | <500ms | ~300ms (with HF API) |
| Response time (cached) | <50ms | <1ms |
| Cache hit rate | >40% | TBD (monitor in prod) |
| False positive rate | <10% | TBD (test with users) |
